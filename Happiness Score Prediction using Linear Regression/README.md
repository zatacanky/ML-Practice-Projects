# Happiness Score Prediction using Linear Regression
The dataset used in the project is [World Happiness Report 2024](https://worldhappiness.report/) and has been taken from [World Happiness Report- 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/world-happiness-report-2024-yearly-updated?select=World-happiness-report-updated_2024.cs).

The goals of this project:
* to explore the distribution of indicators of happiness
* to visualize the happiness scores across the globe on map
* to find the top 20 happiest and unhappiest countries
* to show the the distribution of countries in the happiest and unhappiest 25th percentiles by continent using a pie chart
* to calculate the correlations between the indicators
* to build linear regression models from scratch and with scikit-learn to predict the happiness score of countries based on the indicators measured
