# Happiness Score Prediction using Linear Regression
The dataset used in the project is [World Happiness Report 2024](https://worldhappiness.report/) and has been taken from [World Happiness Report- 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/world-happiness-report-2024-yearly-updated?select=World-happiness-report-updated_2024.cs).

Goals of this project:
* exploring the distribution of indicators of happiness
* visualizing the happiness scores across the globe on map
* finding the top 20 happiest and unhappiest countries
* showing the the distribution of countries in the happiest and unhappiest 25th percentiles by continent using a pie chart
* calculating the correlations between the indicators
* building linear regression models from scratch and with scikit-learn to predict the happiness score of countries based on the indicators measured
* evaluating the performance of the models by calculating the mean squared errors after finding the optimal learning rates.
