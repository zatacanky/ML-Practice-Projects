# NBA Shot Prediction using Logistic Regression
The dataset used in the project is [NBA regular season shot location data from the 2003-04 season to 2023-24](https://github.com/DomSamangy/NBA_Shots_04_24).

The goals of this project:
* to demonstrate the changes in 3-point and mid-range shot rates in the NBA in the last 20 years
* to show the change in share of 3-pointers in all shots attempted by centers over the years
* to find out the team and player that attempted the most 3-pointers in the last regular season
* to identify player(s) that has been playing in the last 20 seasons
* to build logistic regression models from scratch and with scikit-learn to predict the result of the selected shots based on the parameters given
* to find the optimal learning rate and evaluate the perfomances of models
