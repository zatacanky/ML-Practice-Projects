# Credit Card Default Prediction using Decision Trees, Random Forest & XGBoost
The dataset used in the project is [Default of Credit Card Clients](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients) and has been taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).

The goals of this project:
* to build the following models with the optimum parameters to forecast client credit card defaults:
1. a decision tree model from scratch
2. a decision tree model using scikit-learn
3. a random forest model
4. an XGBoost model
* to compare the performance of the models
